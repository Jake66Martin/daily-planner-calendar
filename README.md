# daily-planner-calendar

## Description
This is my daily planner. It uses starter code provided by the carleton university coding bootcamp. It is a daily planner that allows one to input
text within textareas that gets saved to local storage in order to be retrieved and persist on screen, while also being able to be altered at any time. 
It also has color coded timeblocks indicating past timeblocks, the present timeblock, and future timeblocks.
